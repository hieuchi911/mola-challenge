Drawbacks:
- Extension takes some time (sometimes takes 5 secs, sometimes 2 secs) to load the Detected Mood
- Extension can hardly reach tweets further down of the page, hence cannot load the prediction
- As we scroll down, Twitter page tends to remove the added Detected Mood elements, so when we scroll back up, they are not there anymore
